Gaurav, or as I like to call him, the 'John Wick' of our company, because he is a man of focus, commitment, and sheer will. And yes, just like John Wick, he's deadly with pencils, as a designer should be. As a manager, Gaurav went above and beyond to look out for his team. Thanks to him, we learned that being timely didn’t mean giving up on fun, but come project deadlines, I've seen him burn the midnight oil, solo, meticulously polishing every detail until it was just right.
        Gaurav has this knack for brainstorming out-of-the-box UI/UX ideas and always came prepared with a clear plan to bring them to life. His team management skills are as impressive as his design talents, and working alongside him has been an unforgettable experience. Gaurav’s influence is something I’ll carry with me as I move forward. The bar’s set pretty high for the next manager I’ll work with!`

He has this incredible ability to balance user-centric designs with business goals and somehow, he makes even the most complex problems feel like they have an obvious solution (spoiler alert : they don’t, he’s just that good!! :))
        What really sets him apart though is the team culture he has created. He makes sure everyone feels comfortable sharing their opinions (even the bad ones) and trusts you to take ownership of your work but is always there with guidance when you need it. Honestly, it’s the kind of supportive environment that makes showing up to work something you actually look forward to.
        And on top of all that Gaurav is just an all-around great person. If you’re having a tough day he’s the first one to notice and before you know it, he’s brought snacks and queued up the perfect playlist to cheer you up. He’s proof that you can be both a brilliant leader and a kind human, and I feel incredibly lucky to have had him as my manager.✨`

Gaurav gave me the time⏳ and space to adapt to the company's culture and complete my tasks without rushing🏃, ensuring I could bring out my full creativity.🖥️
        One thing he always said that stuck🤯 with me was, “You're a designer, and a designer needs free space to create their best work. Great designs don't happen daily, so let your mind relax." This approach not only helped me grow as a designer but also made me feel understood and valued.❤️
        Gaurav is not just a manager; he's an incredible mentor.👌 He guided me through the nuances of design and supported me throughout my journey at Pitch Catalyst. Whether it was crafting designs or being spontaneous⚡ during client calls📞, I learned a lot from him. His calm 😌and composed 🫡demeanor is something I truly admire and aspire to emulate.😚
        Over time, Gaurav became more than just a manager. He turned into a good friend and even a brother who always had my back.😎 His guidance,👍 encouragement, and ability to listen patiently have been instrumental in shaping my career and personality.🌄
